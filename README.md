# sparkfun_edge_prj_template
Basic template for projects using the Sparkfun Edge development board. It is based on AmbiqSuiteSDK 2.4.2 (Latest version available at https://github.com/sparkfun/AmbiqSuiteSDK).

This template uses the basic demo that tests the ADC and Accelerometer also provided in the SDK but this repository only includes the necessary files for the Edge development board.

The directory structure was also modified a little bit from the one in the examples within the AmbiqSuiteSDK for portability purposes as standalone projects.
